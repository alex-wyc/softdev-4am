# softdev-4am
4am stands for the time at which this project is being done as well as when politicans tweet

#TOPIC
We chose to represent the number of times a candidate tweets in each hour of the day.

#METHOD OF PRESENTATION
We used a cool d3 module which can be find here: http://bl.ocks.org/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6
There are 5 circles to represent each candidate and in each circle, there are different levels of water. The water level represents how many times a candidate has tweeted in that hour. The top of the circle is most number of tweets in an hour. The circles fill up as the candidates tweet more and more during the chosen hour. The hour can be changed using a slider.

#HOW TO USE
Drag the slider to change the time. The water levels will slowly transition. You may also use the arrow keys to change the times.
